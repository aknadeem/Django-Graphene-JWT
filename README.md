# Django Graphene JWT

A Django application that exposes a GraphQL endpoint. Before we dive into the details, let’s go over a couple of concepts:

    `Django` is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design — djangoproject.com
    `GraphQL` is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data — graphql.org
    `Graphene` is a library for building `GraphQL APIs` in Python quickly. `Graphene-Django` is built on top of Graphene and provides some additional abstractions that make it easy to add `GraphQL` functionality to your `Django` [here](project—graphene-python.org)
